Thoughts on using Git and GitHub: I believe Git and Github are essential tools for projects involving
more than one developer. It helps us to work with other developers by giving us useful tools to avoid
any inconvenience. Even though I had no problem working with Git and Github on Assigment 1, we had some
obstacles with my group friends while we are dealing with Assigment 2. We struggled to edit the message
of a previous commit and branches and merges. However, we fixed these issues with the help of our TAs and
our own research. Github has multiple advantages such as the web interface it gives to the developer for
maximized efficiency, ability to create forks, issues through the web interface helps us to manage
problems with clear visuals. One final advantage I noticed is to ability to view different repositories to
find inspirations and find projects to contribute to.
